## Bigdata_Capstone_Project
# Smart Utility Fraud Detection with Python & Power BI  

---

## Overview
This report presents an analysis of sales data to understand key trends and patterns in sales performance. The dataset includes information on sales transactions, including salesperson details, country, product, date, amount, and boxes shipped. The analysis aims to provide insights into sales distribution, performance metrics, and potential areas for improvement.

---
## Problem statement
> **How can we increase the amount of box shipped and create more jobs at the same time?**

### Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze sales transaction data to uncover key trends, patterns, and insights that can help optimize sales performance, improve inventory management, and enhance decision-making for the business.

#### Key Challenges

 - Which regions or products contribute the most to revenue?
2. Identifying Sales Trends
 - Are there seasonal or monthly trends in sales?
 - How does the number of boxes shipped correlate with sales revenue?
3. Evaluating Sales Performance.
 - Which salespersons are the top performers?
 - Are there significant differences in sales performance across regions?

# Data-Driven Recommendations & Insights
> Based on the sales data analysis, here are actionable insights and strategic recommendations to improve business performance:

## 1. Sales Performance Insights
### Key Findings:

- Top-Selling Countries: Australia and India show the highest variability in boxes shipped, indicating fluctuating demand.
- Product Trends: "Peanut Butter Cubes" and "Mint Chip Choco" are among the top-selling products.
- Salesperson Performance: Certain salespersons (e.g., "Jehu Rudeforth") appear frequently in high-value transactions.

### Recommendations:

#### ‚úÖ Focus on High-Demand Regions:

- Allocate more marketing and inventory resources to Australia and India, where sales variability suggests untapped potential.
- Investigate why some countries (e.g., New Zealand) have fewer transactions‚Äîare there market entry barriers?

#### ‚úÖ Optimize Product Offerings:

- Promote best-sellers like Peanut Butter Cubes in regions with lower sales.
- Consider bundling or discounts on less popular products to boost demand.

#### ‚úÖ Incentivize Top Salespeople:

- Reward high-performing salespersons (e.g., commission boosts, recognition).
- Analyze their strategies and replicate them across the team.

## 2. Shipping & Logistics Insights
### Key Findings:

1. High Variability in Shipments:
   - Average boxes shipped: 161.80
   - Extreme outliers (e.g., 709 boxes in one order) suggest bulk purchases or inconsistent demand.

2. Potential Inefficiencies: Some transactions have very low shipment volumes (e.g., 1 box), which may not be cost-effective.

### Recommendations:
i. üöö Implement Tiered Shipping Policies:
   - Offer discounts for bulk orders (e.g., >200 boxes) to encourage larger shipments.
   - Apply a minimum order requirement to reduce small, unprofitable shipments.

ii. üì¶ Improve Inventory Forecasting:
   - Use historical sales trends to predict demand spikes (e.g., seasonal trends).
   - Partner with logistics providers in high-demand regions to reduce delays.

## 3. Pricing & Revenue Optimization
### Key Findings:
 - The "Amount" column had formatting issues (e.g., "$5,320"), requiring cleaning for analysis.
 - No clear correlation yet between price per box and sales volume.

#### Recommendations:
üí∞ Dynamic Pricing Strategy:
   
   - Test price adjustments on low-demand products to stimulate sales.
   - Offer volume-based discounts to incentivize larger purchases.

üìä Further Analysis Needed:

   - Calculate profit margins per product to identify most lucrative items.
   - Compare pricing strategies across regions to optimize revenue.

## 4. Data Quality & Future Analysis
### Key Findings:

- The dataset is clean (no missing values), but the "Amount" column required preprocessing.
- No time-based trends were analyzed yet (e.g., monthly/quarterly sales).

### Recommendations:
üìÖ Time-Series Analysis:

- Analyze seasonal trends (e.g., holiday spikes, monthly fluctuations).
- Adjust inventory and promotions based on cyclical demand.

ü§ñ Predictive Modeling:

- Build a sales forecasting model using historical data.
- Use machine learning to predict future demand per region/product.

## Conclusion
This analysis highlights opportunities to boost sales, optimize logistics, and refine pricing strategies. Next steps include:

1. Deep-dive into time-based trends (seasonality, YoY growth).
2. Implement tiered shipping policies to improve efficiency.
3. Develop a dynamic pricing model to maximize profitability.
